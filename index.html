								<h4>Kinesiology </h4>
								<p>Among the many things my program has taught me, I have learned how exercise, nutrition, and rehabilitation influence health. I have studied anatomy, and physiology in addition to evidence-based techniques used to enhance muscular strength, aerobic fitness, and endurance. I have practiced facilitating healthy exercise engagement, with various specific populations. Analyzing and interpreting exercise test data has allowed me to differentiate between normal and abnormal response profiles. Understanding the latest research theories regarding health psychology has shown me how cultural factors, sedentary behaviour, and psychological illnesses lead to consequences on physical health. </p>

								<h4>Event Planning</h4>
								<p>My experience planning Rock Your Cause, as well as the role of the Manager of the Varsity Girls Soccer Team, has allowed me to sharpen my leadership skills. As the Head of the Rock Your Cause Committee, I planned a school-wide charity event that fundraised over 5000 dollars for various foundations. I was in charge of organizing every aspect of the event, from decorations, food, entertainment, layout, and budget planning, in addition to mentoring club members and reporting to staff. I was responsible for resolving sudden obstacles and managing all aspects to ensure they were prepared for the event date. I have practiced leadership, organizational and creative skills, through this experience. Additionally, I received the opportunity to further my skills as the Manager of the Varsity Soccer team, organizing practices, managing and motivating players. </p>

								<h4>Caregiver</h4>
								<p>I had the opportunity to work in a gym facility, assisting various patients with physiotherapy exercises, while expanding my knowledge of dynamic therapeutic activities. I was able to quickly learn how to adapt my teaching styles to each patientâ€™s learning needs. Leading warm-up and cool-down exercises, as well as training individual participants allowed me to advance my interpersonal and communication skills. I practiced teaching progressive, regressive, and modified exercises, to tailor the workout to suit each particular individual. As well, my experience working as an Occupational Therapist Assistant taught me to plan new, engaging activities to strengthen an individualâ€™s fine motor skills. I was able to arrange various exercises that helped the patient use fine motor muscles to practice bilateral movements, grasping, and various dexterity challenges. </p>
